# R

This repo contains utility scripts and helper functions I use in R. This repository does not contain any next-generation sequencing based R code (i.e. analysis of ChIP-Seq, Ribo-Seq, RNA-Seq, etc). R code of next-generation sequencing applications can be found in the approriate respoitories (i.e. ctrhodes/ChIP-Seq, etc). This repo contains:

1. A quick reference for R based object-oriented programming (OOP). In the OOP dir, I have tried to include references that conform to Bioconductor best practices for developing packages.

2. Various helper functions I often use, which I place in my utilities folder.
